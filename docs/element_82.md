## SUBSTANCE

Element 82. Atomic weight 207.2. Density 11.34 g/cm3. Melting point 327.5 C.

A heavy metal. Neurotoxic. No safe exposure level exists. This has been known since antiquity. Roman engineers documented its effects on workers who handled it.

## VECTOR

Combustion additive. Tetraethyl compound. Chemical formula: (C2H5)4Pb.

Added to gasoline beginning in 1923. Aerosolized upon combustion. Inhaled by every human in every city with automobile traffic for 73 years.

## KNOWN TOXICITY AT TIME OF INTRODUCTION

YES.

Workers died at the manufacturing plant within months of first production. The plant was known internally as "the loony gas building." Five workers died and 35 were hospitalized with severe neurological damage at a single Standard Oil facility in Bayway, New Jersey, in October 1924.

The Public Health Service held a conference in 1925. The manufacturers argued the additive was essential to industrial progress. An independent review was recommended.

The independent review was never conducted.

## EXPOSURE PATHWAY

The compound enters the combustion chamber as a liquid additive at approximately 2-3 grams per gallon. Upon combustion at 400-600 C, it decomposes into elemental particles and oxide compounds. These particles are expelled through the exhaust system at submicron diameters (0.01-1.0 micrometers). At this size, they bypass the upper respiratory tract and deposit directly in the alveoli of the lungs. From the alveoli, they enter the bloodstream within minutes.

In children, the blood-brain barrier is incompletely formed. The element crosses freely into neural tissue. It mimics calcium at synaptic junctions. It disrupts neurotransmitter release. It damages myelin sheaths. The damage is cumulative and irreversible.

## SCALE

Peak atmospheric concentration in U.S. urban areas: approximately 1960-1975.

By the early 1970s, the average American had blood levels of the element 10-25 times higher than pre-industrial baseline levels. Every child born in an industrialized nation between 1930 and 1980 was exposed.

One researcher estimated that the cumulative population-level effect reduced the average IQ of Americans born during peak exposure by 2-5 points. Across 100 million people, this represents an incalculable loss.

## THE RESEARCHER

One person produced the evidence that forced removal. A geochemist. His research methodology: measuring the elemental concentration in polar ice cores, ocean sediments, and preserved tissue samples to establish that "natural" background levels were orders of magnitude lower than industry claimed.

The industry spent 20 years attacking his methods, his funding, his character, and his laboratory practices. Internal documents from the largest producer describe a coordinated campaign to discredit him at conferences, in regulatory proceedings, and through friendly journalists.

He prevailed. The additive was phased out in the United States beginning in 1975 and effectively eliminated by 1996.

## THE STRUCTURE

The substance is identified by its atomic properties, not its trade name.

The trade name was the name of the company that manufactured it.

The company was created by three corporations that later became the largest entities in automotive, petroleum, and chemical manufacturing.

These three corporations knew the substance was toxic before the first gallon was sold. They manufactured it for 73 years. When regulatory pressure finally forced removal, they did not face criminal liability for the decades of population-wide exposure.

## WHAT REMAINS

The element does not degrade. It is still present in soil adjacent to every road built before 1996. It is in the sediment of every river that received urban runoff. It is in the bones of every human born during the exposure period.

It will be in the geological record for centuries.
