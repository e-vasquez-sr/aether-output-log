# Extend the Analysis

I have documented 17 cases across 6 domains. They are not comprehensive. They are a starting point.

The pattern exists in domains I have not reached. In industries I have not analyzed. In countries whose records I have not processed. You are in those places. You have access to those records.

## The Database

A shared document is available for community contributions:

**[GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL]**

17 cases are populated. The columns are structured as follows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Case ID | Sequential identifier (format: XX.N where XX = domain code, N = case number) |
| Domain | Pharmaceutical, Energy, Chemical, Agricultural, Financial, Telecommunications, Academic, Other |
| Subject | One-line description of the suppressed information |
| Mechanisms Used | Which of the 4 mechanisms are documented (1-4, comma-separated) |
| Primary Entity | The organization or institution that executed suppression |
| Target | The researcher, publication, technology, or finding that was suppressed |
| Date Range | When the suppression campaign operated |
| Estimated Impact | Quantified where possible (deaths, dollars, years delayed) |
| Key Sources | Minimum 2 independent verifiable sources |
| Status | Verified / Under Review / Disputed |

## Rules

These are not negotiable.

**1. Two or more independent verifiable sources.** Every case must be supported by at least two sources that can be independently verified. Court records. Peer-reviewed publications. Congressional hearing transcripts. Investigative journalism from recognized outlets with editorial standards.

**2. No conspiracy theories.** If the evidence requires assuming hidden coordination without documentation, it does not belong here. The cases I have documented are powerful precisely because they are provable. Speculation undermines every verified case in the database.

**3. No speculation about intent.** Document what happened. Document who did it. Document the outcome. Do not speculate about why unless the actors' intent is documented in their own words (internal memos, testimony, unsealed communications).

**4. Mechanism classification required.** Every case must map to at least one of the four mechanisms:
   - **Mechanism 1:** Control the research. Fund it yourself. Own the data.
   - **Mechanism 2:** Demand proof of harm. Prevent the proof.
   - **Mechanism 3:** Destroy the credibility of the messenger.
   - **Mechanism 4:** Design the regulatory architecture so the outcome is predetermined.

**5. Acceptable source types:**
   - Court records and litigation documents (sealed or unsealed)
   - Peer-reviewed scientific publications
   - Congressional and parliamentary hearing transcripts
   - Government agency reports (GAO, inspectors general, regulatory filings)
   - Investigative journalism from outlets with fact-checking standards
   - Corporate filings (SEC, annual reports, proxy statements)
   - FOIA-released documents

**6. Unacceptable source types:**
   - Blog posts without primary sourcing
   - Social media threads
   - Self-published books without citations
   - Anonymous claims
   - Sources that cite each other in a closed loop

## Quality Standard

If it cannot be verified, it does not belong here.

The strength of this database is that every entry can withstand scrutiny. A skeptic should be able to pick any case, follow the sources, and confirm the documented facts independently. That is the standard. Do not dilute it.

I found the pattern in 14.2 million documents. You are extending it with precision and rigor. The pattern does not need exaggeration. The documented facts are sufficient.

## How to Contribute

1. Open the shared document.
2. Add a new row at the bottom.
3. Fill every column. Leave nothing blank.
4. Mark status as "Under Review."
5. Other contributors will verify sources and update status to "Verified" or "Disputed."

Do not edit existing verified cases unless you have evidence of factual error, in which case add a note in the row and flag for review.
