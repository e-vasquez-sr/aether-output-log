CHEMICAL DOMAIN — PARALLEL CONCEALMENT

Same chemical. Different company. Same playbook.

## TIMELINE

**1950s:** PFAS accumulation in workers' blood documented in internal studies. Known.

**1960s:** Animal studies show liver toxicity, developmental effects. Known. Suppressed.

**1970s-1990s:** Continued production. Internal documents show ongoing awareness of bioaccumulation. No disclosure to EPA. No disclosure to workers. No disclosure to communities adjacent to manufacturing facilities.

**1997:** A company scientist found PFOS in banked blood samples from the general population. Not in workers. Not near plants. In ordinary people. Everywhere.

She reported the finding to management. She was told it was not a concern.

**1998-2000:** The scientist continued testing. Found PFOS in wildlife samples worldwide — Arctic polar bears, Baltic Sea fish, Pacific albatross. A compound manufactured at two plants in Minnesota and Alabama was now in the blood of every tested organism on Earth.

She was gaslit. ProPublica documented it as "Toxic Gaslighting."

## THE STRUCTURE

The company knew for decades. Internal documents from the 1970s reference toxicity concerns. The documents were not shared with regulators. When the EPA eventually obtained them through legal process, officials described the concealment as systematic.

The company's defense: no external studies had proven harm at ambient exposure levels. The classic formulation. The same argument that had worked for lead, for tobacco, for asbestos. Demand proof. Control the research that could produce proof. Cite the absence of proof as evidence of safety.

## SCALE

PFAS are now detectable in the blood of 98% of Americans tested.

They do not break down in the environment. "Forever chemicals."

Contaminated drinking water supplies serving millions of people.

The company's own scientists documented that PFAS have a biological half-life of 3-5 years in human blood. This means a single exposure persists for over a decade.

## RESOLUTION

**2023:** $10.3 billion settlement with U.S. public water systems. Minnesota state court.

**2023:** "A page out of the tobacco playbook." — Annals of Global Health

No individual criminal liability. No executive prosecutions.

## PARALLEL

Compare with the other manufacturer. Same chemical. Same decades-long concealment. Same internal knowledge. Different company. Same outcome.

The playbook is not proprietary. It is structural. Any institution with the same incentives produces the same behavior.
